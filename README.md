# eWeather desktop app

eWeather is a University Java SE project for PLH24 course (Object oriented programming). It is my first ever project (back in 2018) so please take it easy!
The app parses OpenWeatherMap JSON API and persists data into a local derby database using JPA's implementation EclipseLink.
It features a GUI to display weather information for 5 major cities in Greece.
